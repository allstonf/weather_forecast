# Weather Forecast IoT Device Map

Hypothesis: Weather forecasts in Northern California are more accurate than forecasts in Southern California.

Findings:
- Depending on the location and marker, some parts of Northern California show less Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in their forecast data than in some parts of Southern California. This reduction in MAPE corresponds to a greater accuracy for weather forecasts in some parts of Northern California.
- For context, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is a statistical measure of how accurate a forecast system is. It measures this accuracy as a percentage, and can be calculated as the average absolute percent error for each time period minus actual values divided by actual values.

Steps:
- Go to http://dsc-iot.ucsd.edu/gid07/map_viewer.html
- Hover mouse over Group 7 marker to see info
- Click on marker to look at weather data in a table and charts
- Zoom out map until you see all of California
- Click toggle to show Class Data
- Hover and click on the marker furthest down on the map to show this group's data
- Compare Group 7's data in Northern California with that group's data in Southern California to come to your own conclusion
- Repeat steps with other markers from Northern and Southern California
